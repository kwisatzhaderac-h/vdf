# Dot Files

## Pre-requisites

I currently use:

* zsh as my shell
* oh-my-zsh for zsh plugins
* starship as my prompt
* neovim as terminal-based IDE
* nvchad as neovim ide overlay

## Theme

I mainly use Dracula theme.

Neovim/Nvchad is configured to use Aquarium/Blossom as the dark/light theme.

## Setup

Easy setup is a work in progress.

Currently, running `scripts/create-symlinks.sh` will symlink repo dotfiles to the correct locations.
